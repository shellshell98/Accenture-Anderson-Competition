# Accenture-Anderson-Competition

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:

We have information about past expenditures for individuals from years 2013 to 2017 along with their department names and job titles. The City has provided data for full time, part time, and employees hired for events. Moreover, hourly base rate and total overtime expenses are captured in the dataset.

Given the information, the City of Los Angeles wants us to predict the Ql and Q2 2018 payments for each employee. Furthermore, we are asked to create an optimization plan and recommendations that can help the city to reduce the inefficiencies in the system.
